# Testaurant — website (testaurant)

This repo IS the website for Testaurant. There is no dashboard and no CMS: you
change the site by editing these files and pushing. Live at https://testaurant.pages.dev/.

How to talk to the client, how texted photos arrive (`incoming/`, one level
up), and what counts as Taylor's work are all in the workspace `CLAUDE.md`
one level above this repo. This file covers only this site: what is in it,
how to change it, and how to check a change is live.

## What this site is

- Plain HTML/CSS/JS static files. **No frameworks, no build step, no npm, no
  external JS libraries.** If a change seems to need one, find the plain
  way or say it's out of scope.
- One page: `index.html` (hero, about, the menu, hours and where). `404.html`
  is what the host shows for a missing page. This is the **restaurant**
  template, which is the store layer: the menu and the hours are rows in
  the site's own database (below); ordering is Stripe Checkout for pickup.
- One stylesheet, `css/style.css`. Colors and fonts are the tokens in `:root`
  at the top; change the look there, not scattered through the file.
- One script, `js/main.js` (fade-in on scroll). Motion is transform/opacity
  only, off under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and nothing is hidden with JS off.
- The header, nav, and footer are repeated in every `.html` file (no build
  step means no shared includes). When you edit them, make the same edit in
  **every page**.
- `images/` holds the photos. `_headers` and `_redirects` are read by the
  host, not served: `_headers` makes every page `no-cache` (so nobody ever
  sees a stale page); `_redirects` is for a page that moved. Leave both
  alone otherwise. With a custom domain every page carries a canonical
  link to the bare domain (www serves the same site).
- **No trackers, no analytics, no cookie banners, and no checkout but the
  catalog's own** (Stripe Checkout on the owner's account, below). The only
  forms allowed are the ones that post to patchlamp.com (`newsletter form`
  prints the sign-up box; contact/booking forms follow the workspace
  `PLAYBOOK.md`) or, once the site has a database, to its own `/api/…`
  (below) — nothing else on this site stores visitor information.
- Placeholder content is marked with `REPLACE-ME` comments. Placeholders
  must look like placeholders; never invent facts, prices, hours, or quotes.

## How to change things

- **Copy** (about text, tagline, details, hours, contact): edit the text in
  `index.html`. Ask for anything you don't have; don't guess an address or
  a phone number.
- **A new photo**: save it as a JPG in `images/` with a plain name
  (`images/storefront.jpg`), about 1200px on the long side. Texted photos are
  already converted and resized; move them from `incoming/` (one level up)
  into `images/`. In `photos.html`, copy one whole `<li>…</li>` block (there
  is a commented example), set `src` and `alt`, and remove the "Photos coming
  soon" line once the gallery has a photo. `alt` is a short plain description
  of what's in the photo; never leave it empty. To change the home-page
  photo, replace the placeholder `<svg>` in `figure.about-photo` with
  `<img src="images/…" alt="…">`.
- **A new page**: copy `photos.html`, change the title and content, and add
  it to the nav in **every** page.
- **Colors / fonts**: the `:root` tokens in `css/style.css`.
- **A link** (Instagram, a booking site, a menu on another service): add it
  to the footer list in every page, or as a `.button` in the section it
  belongs to. Linking out is always fine; embedding third-party code is not,
  except a plain `<iframe>` embed from a service the client already uses
  (a map, a player).

## Every change goes live — deploy check

"Done" means live at https://testaurant.pages.dev/, not edited on disk. Relay sessions run from the
client workspace one level up, so git takes the form
`git -C repos/testaurant …`; never `cd` into the repo first (that is always
blocked). After any requested change, without waiting to be asked:

1. Look at your work: `shot repos/testaurant/<page>.html` (add `--mobile` for
   the phone layout) renders the page from disk and saves a picture under
   `shots/`; open it with Read. For anything to do with layout or style, also
   run `shot check repos/testaurant/<page>.html`. Fix what's off before you
   push. If you touched HTML, also confirm the tags you edited are balanced.
2. Commit on `main` with a short plain-English message
   (`git -C repos/testaurant add -A && git -C repos/testaurant commit -m "…"`).
3. Push: `git -C repos/testaurant push`. The repo is the record.
4. Publish: `site publish testaurant`. It sends exactly what is committed to
   the host and prints the live URL once it is serving (seconds, not
   minutes). It refuses if anything is uncommitted or unpushed — that is
   the point, not a bug: fix the git step and run it again.
5. Confirm the live site serves the change, with exactly this shape (no
   pipe, no redirect):

       curl -s https://testaurant.pages.dev/PAGE.html

   (for the home page, `curl -s https://testaurant.pages.dev/`). Read the output and look for the
   new content yourself. Only say it's live once you have seen it there.
   There is no cache to wait out: every page is served `no-cache`, so a
   phone that reloads sees the new page.

Undo the last change with `git -C repos/testaurant revert HEAD`, push, and
publish again. Never force-push, never rewrite history. This is standing
permission from Taylor: don't ask "should I push?" for anything the client
asked for. Do stop if a change would break a rule in this file or delete
something the request didn't clearly ask to delete.

## The server side (only once the site has a database)

A site gets a database with `site data testaurant` (PLAYBOOK § Data). Then
this repo also holds:

- `wrangler.toml` — the binding to this site's own D1 database (`DB`) and
  a few plain settings. Written by `site`; don't edit the binding (`client
  doctor` fails if it stops matching the registry).
- `migrations/NNNN_*.sql` — the tables, applied in order by `db migrate`.
  Never edit one that's applied; add the next number.
- `functions/` — plain JavaScript that Cloudflare runs for `/admin/*` and
  `/api/*` only; every other page stays a static file. `_lib/core.js` is
  shared (the owner's sign-in, page layout); `admin/` is the owner's
  console; `api/<collection>.js` takes a form's posts; `_admin/<name>.js`
  says how `/admin/<name>` shows a list (title, columns, statuses) and
  `_admin/collections.js` lists them. Add a collection with `db add`,
  change a list's title or columns in its `_admin` file, nothing else by
  hand without a reason. No packages, no build step, no secrets in these
  files (the sign-in secret and owner address are Pages secrets).

`site publish` deploys all of it together, so what's live is what's in
git. A new migration goes live with `db migrate` *before* the publish that
needs it. `/admin` pages are never indexed and never cached.

### This site's lists (what's on /admin, and the texts that change them)

| list | table | on the site |
|---|---|---|
| Menu | `products` (a section is `category`) | the menu, `#shop` (from `GET /api/catalog`) |
| Hours | `hours` | the hours box (`data-hours`) |
| Orders | `orders` | written by `POST /api/checkout`, marked paid by Stripe's webhook |

**The shop reads the database live**: a price, a new dish, sold out, or an
hour is one `db exec` and no publish (the catalog README in claude-tools
`templates/collections/catalog/` has the texts). Prices are in cents. Taking
payment needs the owner's Stripe key, set by Taylor (`site checkout`); until
then the button says "Checkout opens once Stripe is connected".

## Hosting (for Taylor)

Cloudflare Pages, one project per site, published by `site publish` from
the committed tree of this repo's `main` (direct upload; no build, no
Cloudflare-side git connection). The repo is on GitHub under `patchlamp`
and stays the record; the host is a mirror of it. A custom domain is
`SITE_ADMIN=1 site domain testaurant example.com` from the workspace (adds
the domain to the project, puts canonical links on every page, prints the
two DNS lines for the registrar). Handing the repo to the
client at the end is `site transfer testaurant <their-github-user>`.
